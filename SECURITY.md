# Google-Sign in for Rails: Security

Security is of utmost importance in an authentication library like Google Sign-In for Rails. We at Basecamp use this plugin in our own apps, so we have a vested interest in investigating and mitigating all reported vulnerabilities. We welcome responsible security reviews and reports from our peers in the open-source software community and strive to acknowledge such valuable contributions.


## Reporting a vulnerability

Send urgent or sensitive reports to **<security@basecamp.com>**. If necessary, use our [public key] to protect your message and provide us with a secure way to respond. We’ll get back to you as soon as we can—usually within one business day. Please follow up or [ping us on Twitter][twitter] if you don’t hear back. For non-urgent or non-sensitive requests, please contact our [support team][support].
